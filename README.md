# Plant Identifier: A Leaf-Based Plant Recognition Project

This project aims to create a web application that identifies plants based on images of their leaves.  Using a combination of frontend, backend, and machine learning, users can upload a picture of a leaf, and the application will return information about the likely plant species.

**Project Goal:**  To build a user-friendly and accurate plant identification tool accessible via a simple website.

**Team:**  A team of four junior developers focusing on different aspects of the project.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main components:

* **Frontend:**  Responsible for the user interface, allowing users to upload images and display results.
* **Backend:**  Acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the machine learning model, handling image processing, communication, and data formatting.
* **Machine Learning (ML):**  The core of the project, responsible for training and deploying the model that identifies plants from leaf images.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:**  [Specify the frontend framework used, e.g., React, Vue, Angular, etc.]
* **Backend:**  [Specify the backend framework and language used, e.g., Python (FastAPI), Node.js (Express.js), etc.]
* **Machine Learning:**  [Specify the libraries and frameworks used for the ML model, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.]
* **Database (Optional):** [Specify the database used if any, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.]
* **Deployment:** [Specify the deployment platform used, e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.]


## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [GitHub repository link]

    Install Dependencies: [Provide instructions for installing the necessary dependencies for each component (frontend, backend, ML)] Example for Python backend:
    bash

    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Application: [Provide instructions for running the application. This will likely involve separate commands for the frontend and backend.]
